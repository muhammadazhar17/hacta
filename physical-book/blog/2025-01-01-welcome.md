# Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Blog

Welcome to our blog dedicated to the fascinating world of Physical AI and humanoid robotics! This space serves as a hub for sharing insights, research updates, technical discussions, and broader thoughts on the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical robotic systems.

## About Physical AI

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence research, moving beyond digital systems to create intelligent agents that interact with and operate within the physical world. Unlike traditional AI systems that process information in digital spaces, Physical AI agents must understand and navigate the complexities of the real world with all its uncertainties, dynamics, and multimodal interactions.

In this blog, we'll explore how Physical AI systems integrate perception, cognition, and action to perform meaningful tasks in real-world environments, with a particular focus on humanoid robotics - robots designed with human-like form and capabilities.
